#summary Getting started using Signal/Collect with Java

To work with the Signal/Collect framework using the provided jar file you *don't* necessarily need to follow the instructions listed in the [RecommendedTools Recommended Tools] section. It is sufficient to simply add the jar file to build path of your java project. The following instructions are for the eclipse IDE but work for other settings in a similar way.

=== Step 1: Download Signal/Collect Jar File===

Download the file "core-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar" from [here] *!!UPDATE ME!!*

=== Step 2: Import Signal/Collect Jar File===

In Eclipse create a new Java Project and add the downloaded jar file to its build path.

To add the jar file to the project follow the following steps
  # right-click on the project in the package explorer tab and select _Build Path_ > _Add external Archives..._
  # select the downloaded jar in the dialogue window.
  # In the package explorer you should now see the jar in your project under _Referenced Libraries_

=== Step 3: First  Algorithm ===
Look at the algorithms [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/#trunk%2Fjavaapi%2Fsrc%2Ftest%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsignalcollect%2Fjavaapi%2Fexamples here] and try to run them and play with them in your project. An explanation of the programming model and the example algorithm is contained [JavaExampleAlgorithm here]
