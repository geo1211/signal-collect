# Maven Central Release 1.1.2 #
Released on March 15th, 2012
  * Some changes to the `pom.xml`, so it could be synced with Maven Central. Fully backward compatible with 1.1.1.

# Bugfix Release 1.1.1 #
Released on December 5th, 2011
  * [Issue 55](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=55) Fixed a bug related to Java/Scala interoperability.

# Java Release 1.1 #
Released on November 28th, 2011
  * [Issue 53](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=53) [Added Java support](http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/wiki/JavaExampleAlgorithm)
  * Changed implementation of factory objects, execution mode objects and termination reason objects to make access from Java straightforward and moved them to the package `com.signalcollect.configuration`
  * [Issue 45](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=45) `Graph.forVertexWithId` is much faster now, but doesn't guarantee that all graph modifications have been executed on the vertex yet. To get the old semantics, call `Graph.awaitIdle()` first.
  * [Issue 46](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=46) `GraphEditor` can be used concurrently now, which allows parallel graph loading (for example using parallel collections).
  * [Issue 47](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=47) `ExecutionInformation.graphLoadingWaitInMilliseconds` was renamed to `ExecutionInformation.graphIdleWaitingTimeInMilliseconds`, because this wait might have other reasons than waiting for the graph to load.
  * [Issue 48](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=48) The reported `ExecutionInformation.graphLoadingWaitInMilliseconds` was wrong. Bug fixed (field was also renamed).
  * [Issue 49](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=49) `DefaultEdgeId` now caches its `hashCode`. This uses more memory but saves CPU time.
  * [Issue 50](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=50) `ExecutionInformation` now has an additional field `totalExecutionTimeInMilliseconds`, which measures  the total algorithm execution time comprised of idle waiting, garbage collection and computation time.
  * [Issue 51](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=51) Added @specialized Annotations to `Vertex`/`Edge`, this improves performance when when using primitives as `id`/`signal`.
  * [Issue 52](https://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/issues/detail?id=52) Using `ConcurrentHashMap` with concurrency level of 1 within the worker, which saves memory compared to the default.
  * Added a Java implementation of the `IdStateAggregator` called `IdStateJavaAggregator`
